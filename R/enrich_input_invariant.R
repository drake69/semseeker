#' What an enrichment can be about (internal)
#'
#' AI-311. An enrichment over pathways takes a **set of genes**. That is not a
#' filter this package applies for convenience, it is what the analysis is: a
#' pathway is a set of genes, so a CpG island is not a member of one and a
#' collapsed per-sample burden is not a gene. The two coordinates are therefore
#' invariants of the enrichment layer — `SCOPE = INSTANCE`, because a gene list
#' needs one row per gene, and `AREA = GENE`.
#'
#' Regions that are not genes are not excluded from enrichment in general: they
#' are mapped onto genes **first**, by a rule that is itself a biological claim
#' ("nearest TSS", "overlaps the promoter", "within N kb" are three different
#' statements). Once mapped, what reaches this layer is `AREA = GENE` again.
#'
#' It exists as a function, and not as two literals, because it used to be two
#' literals — written out by hand in all five backends. Nothing declared the
#' invariant and nothing enforced it: a sixth backend asking for `ISLAND` would
#' have been served, because [assoc_results_get()] accepts any region class (the
#' cross-study overlaps iterate over all of them legitimately).
#'
#' @return list with `scope` and `area`.
#' @keywords internal
#' @noRd
enrich_input_invariant <- function() list(scope = "INSTANCE", area = "GENE")

#' Refuse an enrichment whose input was never computed
#'
#' AI-311. The invariant above used to be applied as a `subset()` on results
#' already read. A result folder holding no `SCOPE = INSTANCE`, `AREA = GENE`
#' row therefore produced *nothing*, quietly: every backend received zero rows
#' and wrote no result. A reader of that folder sees "no significant
#' enrichment", which is a statement about the data, when the truth is "the
#' input was never computed", which is a statement about the pipeline.
#'
#' That gap widened when the two aggregation branches stopped being additive
#' (AI-308): `association_analysis(scope = "SAMPLE")` is now a legitimate and
#' complete request, and it produces a folder on which every enrichment is
#' silently empty.
#'
#' So the check moves to the door and names the remedy. Two failure modes:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item the run has no `GENE` region class at all — nothing a pathway
#'     analysis could be about;
#'   \item it has one, but no inference result carries a per-instance gene row —
#'     the association was run, on something else.
#' }
#' A result file written before `SCOPE` existed as a column cannot be judged and
#' is not blocked: absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence,
#' and blocking on it would refuse folders that are merely old.
#'
#' @param inference_details the requests the enrichment is about to run.
#' @param ssEnv session environment; read from the session when omitted.
#' @return invisibly `TRUE`; called for the refusal.
