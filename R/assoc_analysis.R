#' Association analysis of SEMseeker results
#'
#' Run statistical association models between SEM metrics and a phenotype
#' variable. Supports group tests (Wilcoxon, t-test), GLM families (gaussian,
#' poisson, binomial), quantile regression, correlations (Pearson, Kendall,
#' Spearman), and multi-covariate formulas (e.g.
#' \code{MUTATIONS_* ~ covariate1 + covariate2}).
#'
#' @param inference_details data.frame. Each row defines one analysis run.
#'   Required columns:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{independent_variable}{Sample sheet column used as grouping /
#'       covariate variable.}
#'     \item{family_test}{Statistical model: \code{"wilcoxon"},
#'       \code{"stats::t.test"}, \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"poisson"},
#'       \code{"binomial"}, \code{"pearson"}, \code{"kendall"},
#'       \code{"spearman"}, or quantile regression as
#'       \code{"quantreg_<tau>_<runs>"} (e.g. \code{"quantreg_0.25_2000"}).}
#'     \item{transformation_y}{Transformation applied to the dependent variable:
#'       \code{"none"}, \code{"scale"}, \code{"log"}, \code{"log2"},
#'       \code{"log10"}, \code{"exp"}, or
#'       \code{"quantile_<n>"} (e.g. \code{"quantile_3"}).}
#'     \item{scope}{Required. Which of the two aggregations to run, over the
#'       region classes of the call (\code{areas}, \code{subareas}).
#'       \code{"SAMPLE"} reduces the positions of each class to one number per
#'       sample — the burden, or its density, or a descriptor of the signal.
#'       \code{"INSTANCE"} reduces them to one number per instance of the class:
#'       one row per gene, per island, per cytoband, per probe.
#'
#'       The two are \strong{mutually exclusive}. They used to be produced
#'       together and written into the same file, which made every result the
#'       union of two different questions; a request that wants both now writes
#'       two rows, and each carries its own \code{SCOPE} in the output.
#'
#'       It has no default on purpose. Any default would answer half of what was
#'       asked and say nothing about the other half.}
#'     \item{aggregation}{Required. How the positions are reduced to the one
#'       number the model is fitted on: \code{"SUM"}, \code{"MEAN"},
#'       \code{"MEDIAN"}, \code{"VARIANCE"}, \code{"IQR"}, \code{"MODELOW"} or
#'       \code{"MODEHIGH"}. While every marker admitted exactly one operator
#'       this could stay implicit; a scope now carries several, so the request
#'       has to name the one it wants. Which are admissible depends on the
#'       marker: a count carries \code{SUM} (the burden) and \code{MEAN} (the
#'       density, the form comparable across regions of different size), while
#'       its median and IQR are degenerate; the two modes exist only for the
#'       signal on the beta scale. A request no marker of the run admits is
#'       dropped with a warning naming it, not answered with an empty result.}
#'   }
#'
#'   The markers are \strong{not} named in \code{inference_details} either.
#'   They are chosen by the \code{markers} argument of this call and every row
#'   of the request is tested on all of them, one result file per marker. A
#'   \code{marker} column was documented here for a long time and never existed
#'   in the vocabulary, so a request written from that description was rejected
#'   as carrying an unknown column.
#'
#'   The region classes are \strong{not} named in \code{inference_details}: they
#'   are the \code{(AREA, SUBAREA)} pairs of the run, declared with the
#'   \code{areas} and \code{subareas} arguments of this call and built at
#'   runtime. Both scopes range over the same pairs, so
#'   \code{scope = "SAMPLE"} with \code{areas = c("GENE", "PROBE")} gives the
#'   burden over the gene probes and the burden over the whole sample, and
#'   \code{scope = "INSTANCE"} gives one row per gene and one row per probe.
#'   The artefact is built on the way in if it does not exist yet, so a class no
#'   previous run foresaw costs one scan of the position pivot rather than a
#'   rerun.
#'
#'   Result rows carry the coordinates as columns — \code{MARKER},
#'   \code{FIGURE}, \code{SCOPE}, \code{AREA}, \code{SUBAREA},
#'   \code{AGGREGATION} — never a class name squashed into one of them.
#' @param result_folder character. Path to the SEMseeker result folder.
#' @param maxResources numeric. Maximum percentage of CPU cores to use
#'   (default 90).
#' @param parallel_strategy character. Parallelisation backend; possible
#'   values: \code{"none"}, \code{"multisession"}, \code{"sequential"},
#'   \code{"multicore"}, \code{"cluster"} (default \code{"multicore"}).
#' @param start_fresh logical. If \code{TRUE}, delete previous inference
#'   results before running (default \code{FALSE}).
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to \code{core_init_env()}.
#'
#' @return Invisibly \code{NULL}. Inference result CSV files are written to
#'   the \code{Inference/} sub-folder of \code{result_folder}, one file per
#'   marker/area/family combination defined in \code{inference_details}.
