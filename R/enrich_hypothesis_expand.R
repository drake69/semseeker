#' The two biological questions an enrichment has to answer first (internal)
#'
#' An enrichment over genes is not one analysis, it is a family of them,
#' and which member you ran is decided by two answers. Until this release the
#' package answered both on the caller's behalf and said so nowhere:
#' `util_keys_create()` rewrote every `HYPER` and `HYPO` figure to `HYPER_HYPO`
#' and every region window other than `WHOLE` to `ALL_SUBAREAS`, so no argument
#' of any exported function could reach an enrichment restricted to
#' hypermethylation, or to promoters.
#'
#' The two answers are now the caller's, they have no defaults, and they travel
#' with the result.
#'
#' **Why they are one question and not two.** The direction of an epimutation
#' maps onto transcription only together with where it sits: hypermethylation at
#' a promoter silences, hypomethylation there de-represses, but hypermethylation
#' in the body of a gene is associated with *active* transcription — the same
#' sign means the opposite thing. Naming a direction without naming a region is
#' not yet a biological hypothesis, which is why neither may be omitted.

#' Region windows a `gene_region` answer stands for (internal)
#'
#' The aliases are named after the biology and expand to the windows of the
#' Illumina gene annotation. An alias is admissible here — where the package
#' otherwise refuses to bury a choice in a constant — only because its expansion
#' does not stay hidden: it is written in the log when it is expanded and
#' stamped into the enrichment result, so a reader of that result can see which
#' windows produced it and disagree. A caller who reads `PROMOTER` differently
#' passes the windows explicitly instead.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `PROMOTER` — `TSS200`, `TSS1500`, `1STEXON`. The promoter-proximal
#'     windows, where methylation gates transcription.
#'   \item `GENE_BODY` — `BODY`. The transcribed region, where the association
#'     between methylation and expression runs the other way.
#'   \item `WHOLE_GENE` — `WHOLE`. Every position of the gene, one window: the
#'     hypothesis is that the locus is affected, without saying where.
#' }
#'
#' @param gene_region one alias, or an explicit vector of windows.
#' @return character vector of `SUBAREA` values, and the alias as an attribute.

#' Figures an `epimutation_direction` answer stands for (internal)
