## AI-308 — SCOPE picks one branch of aggregation, and that branch restricts.
##
## Two properties, both of which fail *silently*: a result file is produced
## either way, and it looks complete either way.
##
##   1. EXCLUSIVITY. SAMPLE and INSTANCE are alternatives, not addends. They used
##      to be built together and written into one file, so every result was the
##      union of two different questions and no column said which rows answered
##      which. A request now names its branch and gets that branch only.
##
##   2. RESTRICTION. A collapsed burden on GENE_TSS1500 must be summed over the
##      positions of GENE_TSS1500 and no others. It was not: on the Illumina path
##      anno_probe_features_get() hands back the whole annotation table with NA
##      in the column of the class asked for, and the SAMPLE branch selected its
##      coordinates without dropping those rows — so the mask was the entire
##      array whatever the class, and every "restricted" burden came out equal to
##      the burden of the whole sample.
##
## Session tests use tempFolders indices 18 and 19.
