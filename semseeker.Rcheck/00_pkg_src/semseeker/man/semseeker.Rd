  methylation_data,
  result_folder,
  bonferroni_threshold = 0.05,
  maxResources = 90,
  iqrTimes = 3,
  parallel_strategy = "multisession",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_sheet}{dataframe with at least a column Sample_ID to identify samples}

\item{methylation_data}{matrix of methylation data}

\item{result_folder}{where the result will be saved}

\item{bonferroni_threshold}{= 0.05 #threshold to define which pValue adjusted to define an epilesion}

\item{maxResources}{percentage of how many available cores will be used default 90 percent, rounded to the lowest integer}

\item{iqrTimes}{how many times below the first quartile and over the third quartile the interqauartile is "added" to define the outlier}

\item{parallel_strategy}{which strategy to use for parallel executio see future vignete: possibile values, none, multisession,sequential, multicore, cluster}

\item{...}{other options to filter elaborations}
}
\value{
files into the result folder with pivot table and bedgraph.
